# Linked Art Modelling

[Linked Art](https://linked.art) is an RDF application profile of CIDOC-CRM that uses JSON-LD and the
Getty Vocabularies (such as AAT - the Arts and Architecture Thesaurus) to describe object-based cultural heritage (see [Newbury 2018](https://cidoc.mini.icom.museum/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/CIDOC2018_paper_153.pdf) and [Delmas-Glass & Sanderson 2020](https://doi.org/10.1017/alj.2019.32)).

This repository contains some Linked Art Modelling for my own purposes, especially those that I would like to publish in the context of my PhD Thesis (_Linked Open Usable Data in the Humanities: Perspectives on Semantics and Interoperability_), most probably at `https://data.julsraemy.ch/` (TBD).

Three top-level Linked Art API entities are expected to be serialised: 

- Textual Works (`/text/`) for encoding the chapters, sections and subsections of the thesis
- Digital Objects (`/digital/`) for encoding the notebook entries available on my [PhD Website](https://phd.julsraemy.ch)
- Concepts (`/concept/`) for encoding terms that are not available via the Getty Vocabularies
